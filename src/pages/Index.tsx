    {
      question: "Is an online Will or Trust legally binding?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Our estate planning documents are built by licensed attorneys and customized to meet your specific state's legal requirements. Once you sign them according to your state's witness and notarization requirements (which we provide clear instructions for), they are 100% legally binding and enforceable in court. Thousands of families use online estate planning documents successfully every year."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a Will and a Trust?",
      answer: "A Will takes effect after you die and goes through probate court (a public, 6-12 month process). A Trust takes effect immediately, holds your assets during your lifetime, and transfers them privately after death—avoiding probate entirely. Both name guardians for children and specify your wishes. Choose a Will if you have a modest estate and don't mind probate. Choose a Trust if you own a home, want privacy, or have significant assets ($100K+)."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need an attorney to create a Will or Trust?",
      answer: "No. Our platform is built BY attorneys but designed FOR everyday people to use without legal help. The documents are attorney-crafted, state-specific templates that you customize by answering simple questions. It's the same quality as hiring an attorney, but you save $2,000-$5,000 and avoid multiple appointments. However, if your estate is extremely complex (business ownership, international assets, special needs trusts), you may want to consult with an attorney."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I don't have a Will or Trust?",
      answer: "If you die without a Will or Trust, you die 'intestate' and state law decides what happens to your assets and who raises your children. This process (called intestate succession) may not match your wishes at all. For example, if you're unmarried with kids, your assets might go to your parents instead of your children. Courts will appoint guardians for your kids—possibly someone you wouldn't choose. Plus, your estate goes through probate, which costs 3-7% of your estate value and takes 6-24 months."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I update my Will or Trust after I create it?",
      answer: "Yes! Life changes (marriage, divorce, new children, moving states), and your estate plan should change with it. With a Will plan, you can log back in anytime and create an updated version for a small fee. With a Trust plan, your first year of membership is FREE ($39/year after), which includes unlimited updates. You can add assets, change beneficiaries, update guardians, or make any other changes whenever needed."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know which plan to choose—Will or Trust?",
      answer: "Choose a Will if: you're young (under 40), have minimal assets (under $100K), don't own a home, and are okay with the probate process. Choose a Trust if: you own a home, have assets over $100K, want to avoid probate, value privacy, want faster asset transfer, or have a complex family situation (blended family, children from multiple relationships). Most homeowners choose the Trust plan. Still not sure? The questionnaire will help guide you."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I live in multiple states or plan to move?",
      answer: "Your estate planning documents are state-specific and based on where you currently live. If you move to a new state, you should update your documents to comply with that state's laws. With membership (included free first year with Trust plan), you can easily update your documents for your new state. Some states have significantly different requirements, so updating is important."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need witnesses or a notary?",
      answer: "It depends on your state. Most states require 2-3 witnesses for Wills (who are NOT beneficiaries), and some also require notarization. Trusts typically require notarization but not witnesses. We provide clear, state-specific instructions on exactly what your state requires. You can find notaries at banks, UPS stores, or use online notarization services (available in most states)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my spouse and I create one joint Will or Trust?",
      answer: "We recommend each spouse have their own separate Will or Trust (called 'mirror' documents). This is the standard legal practice and avoids complications. Our couples pricing bundles two individual plans together at a discount ($299 for Will couples plan, $599 for Trust couples plan). Each spouse's documents work together but remain legally separate."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have minor children? How do I name guardians?",
      answer: "Both the Will and Trust plans allow you to nominate guardians for your minor children (and pets!). You can name a primary guardian and backup guardians. If something happens to both parents, the court will appoint your chosen guardian to raise your children. Without a Will or Trust, the court decides who raises your kids—which may not be who you'd want. Naming guardians is one of the most important reasons parents create estate plans."

              <strong>Affiliate Partnership Disclosure:</strong> Mesa Group Consulting is a partner with Trust & Will and may earn a commission if you purchase an estate plan through our platform, at no additional cost to you. We only recommend services we believe provide exceptional value to individuals and families seeking to protect their loved ones and assets.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Legal Service Provider:</strong> Trust & Will is an online estate planning platform that provides state-specific legal documents built by licensed attorneys. Trust & Will is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. The documents provided are legally binding when executed according to your state's requirements (witness and/or notarization). For complex estates, unusual situations, or specific legal questions, consultation with a licensed attorney in your state is recommended.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>State-Specific Requirements:</strong> Estate planning laws vary by state. All documents provided by Trust & Will are customized to comply with your state's specific legal requirements. Requirements for witnesses, notarization, and execution vary by state and document type. Trust & Will provides clear instructions for your state's requirements.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Document Validity:</strong> When properly executed according to state requirements, Will and Trust documents created through Trust & Will are legally binding and enforceable. However, Mesa Group Consulting and Trust & Will cannot guarantee that documents will achieve your specific estate planning goals or prevent all disputes. Complex estates may require additional legal counsel.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Probate Avoidance:</strong> A properly funded Revocable Living Trust can help avoid probate court for assets held in the Trust. However, probate avoidance requires that assets be properly titled in the name of the Trust (process called "funding the Trust"). Trust & Will provides guidance on funding your Trust, but you are responsible for transferring asset titles. Assets not properly transferred to the Trust may still go through probate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Healthcare Directives:</strong> Healthcare directives (Living Will, Healthcare Power of Attorney) communicate your medical wishes and designate decision-makers. These documents are legally binding when properly executed. However, medical providers are not required to honor all requests, particularly those that conflict with medical ethics or the provider's policies. Discussing your wishes with family members and healthcare providers is recommended.
            </p>
